# Phase B — Commit lineage and canonical-source register (§9)

**Status:** COMPLETE for this freeze activation — expanded 2026-09-09 with proven ancestry  
**Date:** 2026-09-08; ancestry tables 2026-09-09

## Charter checklist

| Required | This pass |
| --- | --- |
| Repository full name | YES — growth-verse FE/BE + Piyush1087/dummy_tcs |
| Relevant branches | YES — freeze, origin/development snapshot, origin/freeze lag, integration/clone branches |
| Exact accepted module SHAs | YES — from Phase A register |
| Ancestry + merge bases | YES — `git merge-base --is-ancestor` vs snapshot and local freeze HEAD |
| Already ancestors of prospective head | YES — all IN modules |
| Require convergence | YES — C-02A, C-04, Brand Payouts v1 named, **not pulled** |
| Docs-only commits | YES — C-01 BE I7 ledger; Chat Home ledgers; C-01/C-05 closeout last-touch |
| Developer integration branches | YES — evidence only |
| Branch divergence | YES — origin/freeze is ancestor of local freeze HEAD (unpushed docs) |

## Conclusion used by later phases

Accepted IN modules are already ancestors of the `origin/development` snapshot **and** local `freeze/mvp-canonical-application-v1`. This freeze does **not** pull C-02A, C-04, or Brand Payouts v1. Convergence of those modules is a later amendment, not this freeze.

UCE has named integration merges (FE PR #3 `d39c5ee8…`, BE PR #3 `29224609…`) that are ancestors of the snapshot. Parent-accepted UCE runtime remains the snapshot SHAs.

## Still named (not blockers for Phase C)

- C-01 BE Parent SHA `3ec01751` is docs-only; runtime is present via integrate `c47c6273` + snapshot.
- Brand Settings FE has no separate acceptance SHA (snapshot).
- origin/freeze remotes lag local freeze HEAD (unpushed).
